## 📌 Overview

This enhanced project modernizes the original Java-based Grazioso animal rescue management system by implementing a full-stack web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a Node.js/Express backend with JSON file storage.

Users can intake, search, reserve, export, and manage dog and monkey records through a responsive web interface. The app is supported by a local RESTful API, making it a dynamic and scalable solution for rescue animal operations.
